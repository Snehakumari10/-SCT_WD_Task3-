## Lessons Learned

This project was a great opportunity to reinforce my understanding of core web development concepts:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Gained practical experience in creating and manipulating HTML elements on the fly, such as dynamically adding and removing classes, and updating text content.
* **Event Handling:** Mastered the use of `addEventListener` to listen for user interactions and trigger corresponding functions.
* **State Management:** Learned to effectively manage the game's state using JavaScript arrays to track the board's condition and player turns.
* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Developed and implemented a structured algorithm to check for all possible winning conditions and draw scenarios.
* **Functional Programming:** Organized the code into modular functions (`handleCellClick`, `checkWinner`, `restartGame`) for better readability and reusability.
* **Responsive Web Design:** Applied CSS techniques to ensure the game is visually appealing and functional across various devices.
